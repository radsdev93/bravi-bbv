Bravi's Balanced Brackets Verifier Test

This is a simple project to check a string for balanced brackets of any kind (parenthesis or round brackets, brackets or square brackets, and braces).

## What does "balanced brackets" mean?

Balanced brackets mean that for either open/left bracket, there is a respective right bracket for it, and if there are multiple bracket characters, they are properly enclosed (following the Mathematics expressions priority order). To make it more accurate, going a little further from the provided instructions, strings that are null or empty won't be evaluated, as well as strings that does not contain any bracket character. Strings that contain any kind of character **and** brackets characters will also be evaluated, though. Values that are not a literal string won't be evaluated as well.
